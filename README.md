# Streamlet

Streamlet is my Solo Project for Prime Digital Academy.

Streamlet came out of the problem of wanting to watch a specific movie or tv show and not knowing if/where it's streaming. It can be tedious to search the various streaming services. The available web searching options are not always user friendly. I wanted to create an app that would be easy to use.

## How To Use

In order to run this app, run npm install in the terminal in order to download the dependencies for the app. It can be accessed in the browser from localhost:3000.

On the home page, a user can search for a movie or a tv show by entering the title in the search bar. The user must select the radio button indicating whether they are looking for a movie or a tv show. The results of the search will be displayed on the page, along with information on where the titles are available to stream.

Users are also able to create an account by clicking on the "register" button. By creating an account and logging in, users can still search for titles, but are also able to save search results. The saved titles are displayed on the list page. This can be useful if a search result comes up that the user finds interesting, or as a way to keep a list of movies and tv shows that they would like to watch in the future, without all the titles having to be on the same streaming service.

##Stretch Goals

In the future, I would like to be able to make it so search results and saved titles contain links to the streaming services they are available on. I would also like to be able to alert users when titles on their list are available to stream on a new service. I would also like to deploy the app to be used by others.
